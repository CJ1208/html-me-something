					<h2>Hyderabad, IND</h2>
						<p>I was born and brought up in a small town called Galiveedu in Andhara pradesh, India, I started my carrier in Hyderabad and built my extended family there. It is one of the best city  I've lived in my life</p>
						<p>If there is one word that can be used to describe the culture in Hyderabad, it is diverse. Owing much to its very rich history, from its inception by the Qutub Shahi dynasty to the occupation of the Mughal Empire and its decline and fall, and the subsequent rise under the Asaf Jahi dynasty, the city has been the place where the traditionsâ€“both cultural and linguisticâ€“of North India and South India meet. Hyderabad culture can also be seen through the various monuments and iconic architectural structures in the city that are testaments to the cityâ€™s glorious history, such as the Charminar and the Golconda fort. The residents of the city refer to themselves as Hyderabadis and they have developed for themselves a culture that is distinctly a mixture of both Muslim and Hindu traditions</p>
